Step 1: Load Dataset
In this step I imported the required libraries and loaded the dataset.
This helps me to see how many rows and columns are in the data.

Step 2: Data Analysis
Here I checked the first few rows of the dataset and the column names.
This step gave me an idea about what kind of data I am working on.

Step 3: Visualization
I created graphs to understand the dataset better.
For example, I plotted the distribution of depression levels and the correlation between emotions.
Graphs make it easier to explain the data in a simple way.
Step 4: Model Training
In this step I used a Decision Tree Classifier to train my model.
I split the dataset into training and testing parts, and then trained the model on training data.
Later I checked the accuracy on the test data.

Step 5: Results & Conclusion
Finally I checked the classification report and accuracy score.
The model gave almost 89% accuracy which is a good result.
I learned that emotions and depression levels have a strong relation.
This project helped me to understand how data analysis and machine learning work together.
